                <h2>Nana Magdalena Gamayo</h2>
                <p>
                    Magdalena Gamayo, a native of Pinili, Ilocos Norte, learned the Ilocano weaving tradition of making inabel from her aunt at age 16. She taught herself on how to execute the traditional patterns of binakol, inuritan (geometric design), kusikos (orange-like spiral forms), and sinan-sabong (flowers). She became best known for weaving the sinan-sabong, since it is the most challenging pattern among the four.
                    Her father bought her first loom, made by a local craftsman using sag'gat hardwood. Gamayo's loom lasted for 30 years. Already past 80 years old, Gamayo remained committed in making inabel.  </p>

                <p>
                    The Garlic Farmer's Monument is a sculpture in the town of Pinili, Ilocos to commemorate its hard-working farmers. A family of five, pulling a carabao-drawn carriage locally known as a karison made of bamboo loaded with baskets of native garlic, was immortalized.
In November 2015, the provincial government's pledge to improve the production and development of Ilocos Norte's agriculture sector was strengthened with the announcement of its flagship program, "Paspas Dur-as Biag ti Away! "(Rapid Rural Development). Then the PAO performed three-day agricultural training on commodity production and sound business practices. Aside from improving the agricultural economy, bawang was also at the heart of recent tourist attractions such as the Darat Garlic Heart and Pinili's Garlic Farmers Monument.
